         * conditions, this would only be needed by mapping applications that
         * need to display the location in real-time. This also has the most
         * severe power impact.
         *
         * Most applications definitely want to receive updates at a specified
         * interval, and can receive them faster when available, but still want
         * a low power impact. In such cases, PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY
         * combined with a higher fastest interval (such as 1 minute) and a
         * slower periodic interval (such as 60 minutes) may be appropriate.
         * "Balanced' location updates will only assign power blame for the
         * interval set by setInterval(long), but can still receive locations
         * triggered by other applications at a rate up to the fastest interval.
         * This style of request is appropriate for many location aware
         * applications, including background usage. Care should be taken to
         * throttle the fastest interval in case heavy work, such as using the
         * network, is to be performed after receiving an update.
         *
         * PRIORITY_LOW_POWER is appropriate for "city" level accuracy. City
         * level accuracy is considered to be about 10km accuracy. Using a
         * coarse accuracy often consumes less power.
